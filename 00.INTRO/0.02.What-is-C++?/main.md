# What is C++

## Before C++ there was C

The C language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone laboratories, 
primarily as a systems programming language (a language to write operating systems with). 
Ritchie’s primary goals were to produce a minimalistic language that was easy to compile.
C ended up being so efficient and flexible that in 1973, Ritchie and Ken Thompson rewrote 
most of the Unix operating system using C. C has excellent portability, allowing Unix to be 
easily recompiled on many different types of computers and speeding its adoption

## C++

C++ (pronounced see plus plus) was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an extension to C, 
starting in 1979. C++ adds many new features to the C language, and is perhaps best thought of as a 
superset of C, though this is not strictly true (as C99 introduced a few features that do not exist in 
C++). C++’s claim to fame results primarily from the fact that it is an object-oriented language.

## Philosphy

Although they both are high end languages they provide a lot of control over the hardware and provides
the programmer a *lot* of freedom. *"With great power comes great responsibility"*. Hence, knowing what not 
to do is almost as important as knowing what to do.
