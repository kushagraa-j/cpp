# Structure

In this part we will talk about the basic structure of a c++ program, now that you know what is a statement and a functiion.

```
#include<iostream>              \\ include files from library
#include<my.h>                  \\ include local personal files

int yourfuncname(int x){        \\ your custom function with a argument x

	// statements
	return 0;               \\ As it is a int return type function, it must return a integer value

}


int main{ 

	\\ statments
	return 0;

}
