# Functions

It is a set statements running in sequential order contributing to do a specific task 
inside a program is called a function. As we took a human body example in the previous, lets take 
one here too. We can compare functions to tissues, *not exacty* but think of statements as cells 
trying to perform a specific task.

If that doesnt make much sense, screw the example.

Every C++ program must have a special function named main (all lower case letters). 
When the program is run, the statements inside of main are executed in sequential order.

A function named “max” might contain statements that figures out which of two numbers is larger. 
A function named “calculateGrade” might calculate a student’s grade from a set of test scores. 

The code of a function resides inside two curly braces {}.
