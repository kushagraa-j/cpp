# How to develop a program?

As we have started to learn programming we must know how to program. Most of the poeple forget 
this part and start coding.

# What

Before all, you must know *what* you are gonna make. Its a really important question, if you dont know what you are coding for, then um,
what are you even doing? Define your application of the program.

Example:

- I want to make a program which adds two numbers
- I want to make a program to calculate my BMI

# How

As you have figured out, what to program, the next step is obviously how to. We havent reached the coding part yet.
It is also the step that is most neglected in software development. The crux of the issue is that there are many ways 
to solve a problem -- however, some of these solutions are good and some of them are bad. Too often, a programmer will 
get an idea, sit down, and immediately start coding a solution. This often generates a solution that falls into the bad 
category.
