# How to develop a program?

As we have started to learn programming we must know how to develop a useful program.

# What

Before all, you must know *what* you are gonna make. Its a really important question, if you dont know what you are coding for, then um,
what are you even doing? Define your application of the program.

Example:

- I want to make a program which adds two numbers
- I want to make a program to calculate my BMI

# How

As you have figured out, what to program, the next step is obviously how to. We havent reached the coding part yet.
It is also the step that is most neglected in software development. The crux of the issue is that there are many ways 
to solve a problem -- however, some of these solutions are good and some of them are bad. Too often, a programmer will 
get an idea, sit down, and immediately start coding a solution. This often generates a solution that falls into the bad 
category.Typically, good solutions have the following characteristics:

- They are straightforward (not overly complicated or confusing).
- They are well documented (especially around any assumptions being made or limitations).
- They are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without impacting other parts of the program.
- They are robust, and can recover or give useful error messages when something unexpected happens.

Before coding, you can create a *pseudocode*,In computer science, pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an 
program. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather 
than machine reading. You can lay down how to program shall run in your own language making it easier to code. 

Coding is just a way of expressing yourself in a language. What really matters is what you are trying to express.

# Coding

Once you are thorough about what and how are you are going to code. Open up your editor, start coding and express yourself.
A programming language is just like another language. It has syntax as grammar and spelling in a normal language. Coding is not as hard 
as it may seem. Enjoy the process, do it as computer were a person and you were talking to him.

# Compiling

Well, once you have coded the code must be compiled into machine code so that the hardware can execute it.
This is done using a compiler. 

# Linking

A linker is the piece of software which brings together all the required files mentioned inside the program.
The linker also is capable of linking library files. A library file is a collection of precompiled code that has been 
“packaged up” for reuse in other programs.

# Test

Once everything is done and you have a executeable, go and execute your program and see if you got the desired output.
If you havent, dont lose your heart, thats a part of being a programmer and its very common, go ahead and debug your code i.e
see where the error lies, and what is stopping you to have a improper output.
